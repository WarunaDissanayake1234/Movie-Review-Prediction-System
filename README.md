# Movie Review Prediction System with RNN

This repository contains code for a deep learning model that predicts sentiments of movie reviews using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) implemented with Keras.

## Overview

This project implements a deep learning model using an RNN architecture to predict sentiment (positive or negative) from movie reviews. Python programming language was used for implementation, and Google Colab served as the development environment.

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (for running the code)
- Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WarunaDissanayake1234/Movie-Review-Prediction-System.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow keras
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook or upload the provided notebook to Google Colab.
   - Follow the instructions within the notebook to preprocess the data, define the RNN model, train it, and predict sentiment from movie reviews.

## Files

- `movie_review_prediction_rnn.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the movie review sentiment prediction model using RNN.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for training and testing.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of movie reviews along with their sentiments (positive or negative). The objective is to predict sentiment polarity based on these reviews.

## Acknowledgments

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the in-built datasets available in the Keras library.
